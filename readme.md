JavaScript Projects
Here are a few small projects I've created using JavaScript.

Projects
Pizza Menu
Tic-Tac-Toe Game
Calculator
Pizza Menu
This project allows users to order pizza by selecting from a variety of toppings. The program then processes the input and calculates the total price for the order.

Tic-Tac-Toe Game
This is a digital version of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game. The game begins by randomly rolling dice to determine which player goes first. Users can choose their tokens, and the game celebrates the winner with music and flashing lights.

Calculator
This project is a simple four-function calculator. It enables users to perform basic arithmetic operations—addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division—on a clean, web-based interface.
